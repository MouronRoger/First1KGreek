# First1KGreek Code Cleanup (2025)

This document outlines the changes made during the code cleanup process for the First1KGreek repository.

## Overview of Changes

The following improvements were made to the codebase:

1. **Fixed Deprecation Warnings**
   - Resolved ElementTree deprecation warnings about testing element truth values
   - Updated XML parsing code to use explicit `is None` checks instead of boolean evaluation

2. **Code Structure Improvements**
   - Created a dedicated Python virtual environment for development
   - Improved code organization and readability
   - Added proper error handling and logging

3. **Documentation**
   - Added detailed comments to explain complex code sections
   - Created a requirements.txt file to document dependencies
   - Added this README to document changes

## Files Modified

- `browse_texts_fixed.py`: A modernized version of the original `browse_texts.py` script
- `requirements.txt`: Added to document project dependencies

## How to Use

### Setup

1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Run the improved browser:
   ```
   python3 browse_texts_fixed.py
   ```

3. Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:8000/

## XML Data Preservation

The XML data structure remains unchanged. All modifications were made to the code that processes the XML files, not to the data itself. The application continues to:

- Browse authors and their works
- View XML files in both raw and reader-friendly formats
- Search across the corpus
- Browse by editor

## Testing

The application has been tested with various XML files from the repository to ensure that:
- Navigation between pages works correctly
- XML files are displayed properly in both view and reader modes
- Search functionality works as expected
- No deprecation warnings are shown

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for further improvement:

1. Add proper unit tests for the application
2. Implement a more robust XML parsing system
3. Add pagination for large result sets
4. Improve search performance for large corpora
5. Add more metadata extraction and display
6. Implement a more modern UI framework

## Original Project

This is a fork of the [OpenGreekAndLatin/First1KGreek](https://github.com/OpenGreekAndLatin/First1KGreek) project, which contains XML files for works in the First Thousand Years of Greek Project.
